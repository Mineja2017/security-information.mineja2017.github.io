# Summary

The paper is really extensive, but as asked we are focusing on section 3.2 Kill Chain. The author introduce the concept of Intrussion Kill Chain as a model to understand and define the structure of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) intrusion. We have to think as a cyber attack as phased progression, rather than a single event. All the steps must be completed to succeed. These are the steps:

1. Reconnaissance
    - The attacker researches, identifies, and selects targets. (Extra) For this case you have 2 options:
        - Fingerprinting:
            - It is also called active reconnaissance, as for doing it you need to interact with the target. (nmap for example)
        - Footprinting:
            - It is also called passive reconnaissance, as for doing it you don't need to interact with the target. (public info, OSINT, etc)
2. Weaponization
    - The attacker makes a remote access trojan or exploit with a deliverable payload that will be injected into the target system.
3. Delivery
    - The attacker delivers the payload to the target system.
4. Exploitation
    - The malicious code triggers and exploits a vulnerability.
5. Installation
    - The attacker installs a backdoor or malware to maintain persistence in the environment.
6. Command and Control
    - The compromised system establishes an alternative channel to the attacker’s server to receive instructions.
7. Actions on Objectives
    - The attacker achieves their original goal. (Exfiltration of data, Ransomware, etc)

The key point to understand is that an attacker must complete all the steps to succeed. But as a defender, we can stop the attack at any point.

# Task a

## Tactic

In the MITRE ATT&CK matrix a tatic is a high level action that an intruder can perform to achieve their objective. For example, Persistence, Privilege escalation, etc. This is represented by columns in the matrix.

## Technique
Is the action done by the intruder to achieve the tactic. For example, Modify the registry to maintain persistence. This is represented by cells in a column of the matrix.

## Sub-Technique
Provides a more detailed description of the technique. For example, A Sub-technique of "Brute Force" (Technique) would be "Password Spraying" (Sub-technique).

## Procedure
This represents how the technique is executed. For example, a Procedure of "Password Spraying" (Sub-technique) would be "Use a list of common passwords to try to login to a system" (Procedure).

# Task b and Voluntary activity.

I alrready have a kali linux vm installed on my laptop. See images attached.
